This is how we get rich

Main problem:
Take in a sound file and in real time:

--1. Split it into short intervals
--	1. Compress signal (make all notes equally loud)
--	2. Do clustering (this way we handle legato phrases as easily as staccato)
--	3. For each cluster, find earliest and latest observation
--	4. Split signal
--2. Apply FFT
1. Do a harmonic wavelet transform
2. Detect onset
3. Machine Learning is pathway to many abilities, some consider to be... unnatural.
4. ????
5. PROFIT
